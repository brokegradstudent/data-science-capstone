Interactive Data App: Attacks on Healthcare Workers Globally, 2020-2023

This app was designed to analyze, visualize, and explore a dataset of reported incidents targeting healthcare workers in areas of conflict around the world. The dataset, which was compiled by the Safeguarding Health in Conflict Coalition or SHCC, contains 950 distinct, reported incidents from the COVID-19 era (2020-2023) in which workers were killed, kidnapped, arrested, and/or injured in 62 countries. Data collected includes country name, geographic coordinates, reported perpetrators, the number of health workers affected, and the nature of the incident (murder, kidnapping, arrest, injury, or combination). The app provides two sets of data analyses: one at the global level and another at the country level.

The global analyses contains two dynamic graphics: one world map displaying the geolocation of incidents by type (Figure 1), and a bar chart which shows global incident type frequency throughout the reporting period (Figure 2). To explore the global data using the geolocation data, the user can double click on the map legend to show only one incident type at a time. Additionally, the user can select/deselect checkboxes next to the four main incident types using the checklist located in between the the map and the bar chart, which then shows the selected data on both graphics. 

To guide users in their exploration of the data using the dynamic graphics, two static graphics are also included as a reference in the middle of the page between the global and country-level interactive graphics: a bar chart displaying the number of health workers affected by attacks in each country (Figure 3) and a heat map showing the geographic distribution of these affected health workers (Figure 4). I felt it was especially important to provide a static overview of the data as, for many of the countries included, there are only a handful of incidents, so country-level graphics may be misleading without the broader context.

The country-level analyses contains three dynamic bar charts: the first shows the temporal distribution of incidents over the reporting period (Figure 5); the second displays the frequency of perpetration by local repeat perpetrators (Figure 6); and the third compares the number of health workers affected by state/province/district (Figure 7). To explore these three charts, the user can select a country from the dropdown menu located just above these three graphs.
